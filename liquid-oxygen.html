    <h1>Liquid oxygen</h1>
    <p>In rocket propellant</p>
    <p>Liquid oxygen is the most common cryogenic liquid oxidizer propellant for spacecraft rocket applications, usually in combination with liquid hydrogen, kerosene or methane.[11][12]
        
        Liquid oxygen was used in the first liquid fueled rocket. The World War II V-2 missile also used liquid oxygen under the name A-Stoff and Sauerstoff. In the 1950s, during the Cold War both the United States' Redstone and Atlas rockets, and the Soviet R-7 Semyorka used liquid oxygen. Later, in the 1960s and 1970s, the ascent stages of the Apollo Saturn rockets, and the Space Shuttle main engines used liquid oxygen.
        
        In 2020, many rockets used liquid oxygen:
        
        Chinese space program: Long March 5, and its derivations Long March 6, Long March 7
        Indian Space Research Organisation: GSLV
        JAXA (Japan): H-IIA and H3 (under development)
        Roscosmos (Russia): Soyuz-2 and Angara (under development)
        ESA (EU): Ariane 5 and Ariane 6 (under development)
        Korea Aerospace Research Institute (South Korea): KSLV-1 and KSLV-II
        United States
        SpaceX: Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy and Starship (under development) (liquid oxygen chilled to −207 °C (−340.6 °F; 66.1 K), 10% denser 1,250 g/L (1.25 g/ml)[13] than at boiling temperature)
        United Launch Alliance: Atlas V, Delta IV, Delta IV Heavy, Vulcan (under development)
        Northrop Grumman: Antares 230+
        Blue Origin: New Shepard and New Glenn (under development)
        Rocket Lab: Electron
        Firefly Aerospace: Firefly Alpha (under development)
        Virgin Orbit: LauncherOne</p>
