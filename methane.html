    <h1>Methane</h1>
    <p>What is the big problem with methane?</p>
    <p>Methane is the main contributor to the formation of ground-level ozone, a dangerous air pollutant and greenhouse gas whose exposure causes 1 million premature deaths each year. Methane is also a powerful greenhouse gas. Over a period of 20 years, it is 80 times more potent at warming than carbon dioxide.

        Methane has been responsible for about 30% of global warming since pre-industrial times and is proliferating faster than at any time since record keeping began in the 1980s. According to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric United States, even as carbon dioxide emissions slowed during the 2020 pandemic-related lockdowns, atmospheric methane skyrocketed.</p>
